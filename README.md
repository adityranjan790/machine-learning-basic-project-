# ðŸ“Š Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Pipeline with XGBoost

This repository provides a **two-stage Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) pipeline** implemented in Python, using **XGBoost** for regression and enhanced visualization for diagnostics.  
The pipeline is designed to model relationships between marketing spend and business outcomes (e.g., revenue), using **time-series cross-validation** to evaluate performance.
